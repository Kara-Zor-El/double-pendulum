# Double-Pendulum

- This project is a Double Pendulum I made using Unity

- It was a fun project I tried to do in less than 24 hours and ended up taking more time but worked on it for less than 24 hours. 

- It tought me a lot of good stills for how to code efficiently and on a time crunch

## If you want to check out the demo heres the ![Itch.io](https://kmp3e.itch.io/double-pendulum) link
In addition I have also included some WebGL builds of it if you would like to run it yourself or you can build it yourself using Unity (Version 2019.4.26f1)
